# ISAC SHD Venu 2 Watch Face

Inspired by "The Division™" Game from Ubisoft

# General Idea
The Goal is to Design a Watchface that copys the ISAC Assistant distributed to all Agents

### Plans for the Design
- ISAC still background
- possible moving isac background (Might shave of a lot of battery efficiency tho, gotta get that fixed in a way)
- possible Sound alerts upon different triggers (Freezing temperature, high Heart Rate, etc)

# 🛠️ Known Issues and Bugs
Severity | Symptom | Fix
--|--|--
Medium/Severe | If the watch isnt connected to the Phone the Watchface doesnt render correctly, or just blackscreens/gets stuck in a loading Loop with the animated Background | possibly by nullvalue catching

If you find more please open a new issue in this repository, or write me an email to [this Email](mailto:jadre03.2@gmail.com?subject=Issue%20With%20SHDWatchface)

# 🛣️ Roadmap

Getting the Watchface as a normal Watchface to run is the first Priority of course, but theres further things that are possible and might be implemented in a later iteration of the Watchface

### Features that are working
- Ambient Temperature
- Time and Date
- Battery in Percentage
- Percipiation Chance
- Animated Background
- Heart Frequency
- Steps and Stress Level
- Continued Support of newer Models of Watches (especially the Venu Series)

### Features that are still TODO
- weather forecast
- Weather warning
- BPM Warning
- Stress Warning

# 📢 Information Board

Since i havent worked with Monkey C as of yet and im busy with work and my Apprenticeship this repository might be dormant for a while

### Edit 12/2024:
Theres very little features as of yet, however the Battery efficiency is (understandably) quite high

### Edit 9/2025
The Background animation is working now, battery efficiency is now down again, for me its a recharge every 3 days

### Edit 10/2025
Support for the Venu 2+ and 3 has been added, steps stress and heartrate has been added

### Edit 11/2025
Support for Venu 4 in 45 and 41mm Screen Variants, Heartrate moniker changed from BPM to HR
